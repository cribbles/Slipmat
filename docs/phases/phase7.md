### Views
* I'm pretty sure this will just involve overloading the API search endpoints
to accept GET requests for particular filter parameters (i.e. where params) and
very slightly expanding the Backbone Index views.  Subviews won't be necessary,
as the only differences will be (1) the particularities of the
`Record`/`Artist`/`Label` payload and (2) the addition of a few 'filters' in
the Index view, too simple to necessitate a subview - see my RecordsIndex
wireframe for an example.
